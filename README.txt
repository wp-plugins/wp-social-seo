Single plugin for social media - With Social SEO, you can now also display Twitter, Facebook, custom text and a testimonial & custom images, all from the same widget.

This is great for SEO, as it adds a lot of unique, random high quality text on a per page basis --> quality content, that Search Engines love, without creating 4 different widget areas. Everything is contained within that one widget.

One widget, means faster page loads compared to having 3 or 4 different widgets loading on the same page.
